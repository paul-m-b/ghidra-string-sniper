    - examines different 'flavors' of deep research that exists and provides a good overview of what it is and how it works.
    - explains the different "workers" that deep research typically employs

    - openai paper on what deep research is.
    - started as early o3 model
        - web-oritented agentic model
    - performs searches, follows links, opens PDFs
    - can also run python in sandboxed environment for data analysis
        - sandboxed env has no internet access. not important to what we're talking about, but interesting how it's implemented.
    - performs multi-step research. searches, reasons, then analyzes results with citations to relevant sources.
    - trained on different data sets, focused on research use cases.
    - "The training datasets contain a range of tasks from objective auto-gradable tasks with ground truth
answers, to more open-ended tasks with accompanying rubrics for grading. During training, the
model responses are graded against the ground truth answers or rubrics using a chain-of-thought
model as a grader."
    - something I didn't realize:
        - deep research itself is an agentic solution -- not a new type of model
            - exciting because it may allow (force?) us to make our own path with the deep research.
            - essentially, we would make a deep research agent for finding external sources of truth, instead of using one... this makes more sense to me now lol
    - models good with tool calling excel here, since it's essentially an agentic solution wrapped around and made to look like a regular model/chat service sort of thing.

    - DeepSearch vs deepresearch
    - search -> read -> reason loop
        - keeps looping until satisfactory answer or token/arbitrary limits are hit.
    - DeepResearch seems to utilize DeepSearch but is particularly focused on providing a research-type report
    - DeepReserach runs many deepsearch instances and then consolidates into a nice format. 
    - DeepSearch is the technique we would need to implement. I don't think we care about the final part of turning our results into a nice format.
