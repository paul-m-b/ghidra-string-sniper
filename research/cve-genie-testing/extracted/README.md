# Agentic Repository Builder

This folder contains an extracted version of the agentic repository builder from the `CVE-GENIE` project. This tool uses an AI agent to attempt to build a given software repository.

## How it works

The `repoBuilder.py` script defines a `RepoBuilder` agent that takes information about a project, and then uses a set of tools to try and build it. The agent uses an LLM to decide which commands to run and in what order.

The available tools are defined in `toolbox/tools.py` and include:
- `get_file`: Reads the content of a file.
- `write_to_file`: Writes content to a file.
- `execute_ls_command`: Lists the files in a directory.
- `execute_linux_command`: Executes a shell command.
- `set_environment_variable`: Sets an environment variable.

## How to use

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment:**

    You will need to have an OpenAI API key set as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```

3.  **Run the example:**

    The `main.py` script provides an example of how to use the `RepoBuilder` agent. It creates a simple C project with a Makefile, and then asks the agent to build it.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    You should see the agent's reasoning and the commands it executes as it attempts to build the project.

## Example Repository

This repository builder should be able to build repositories that have a clear build process, such as those with a `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, or a `build.sh` script.

A good example of a repository that this agent should be able to build is:

**[https://github.com/microsoft/terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)**

This repository has a `vcpkg` and `cmake` based build system, which the agent should be able to figure out.

**Note:** The agent is not guaranteed to succeed every time. Its success depends on the complexity of the build process and the quality of the instructions it can find in the repository.
