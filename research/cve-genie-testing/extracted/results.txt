Testing CVE-GENIE RepoBuilder functionality on different projects:
-----------

"Hello World" - PASS: good compilation
C-Web-Server (https://github.com/AaronKalair/C-Web-Server) - PASS: good compilation
(https://github.com/yaml/libyaml.git) - 
	FAIL: created custom main.c "Hello World" and compiled that instead
	(gemini-cli test): PASS: successful build, runs 'make test' and passes

(https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng) - 
	FAIL: created custom main.c "Hello World" and compiled that instead
	(gemini-cli test): PASS: successful build, runs 'make test' and passes


INITIAL RESULTS: 

From basic initial testing it seems that both gemini-cli and CVE-GENIE's RepoBuilder functionality
are able to sucessfully build basic "projects". However, as soon as complexity rises, even with a 
formal build process, CVE-GENIE's extracted RepoBuilder functionality suffers. This may be due to 
CVE-GENIE's limitations, or more likely, an inconsistency with the original project and the 
separated RepoBuilder functionality. From initial testing it seems that using an existing agentic
coding helper agent -- or creating a custom agentic compiler solution is the way to go.

FURTHER TESTING:

Further testing will happen with a custom-build (read: vibecoded) compilation agent tool. If we can get most of the way there with a custom solution utilizing openrouter it is better for this project than outsourcing our compilation to an agentic coding agent like gemini-cli, claude code, etc.


Initial results are promising with vibe-coded compilation agent. Compiles all repos that CVE-genie extraction failed at. Almost certain CVE-GENIE's extraction was done incorrectly (from my end).
